# MovieLens-32M Extension

The **MovieLens-32M Extension** dataset, as described in the paper
*Extending MovieLens-32M to Provide New Evaluation Objectives*, by
Smucker and Chamani, is available for research purposes.

## **Access and Usage Restrictions**

This dataset is **only available to researchers** for **research on
evaluation of recommendation systems and similar purposes**.

To access the dataset, researchers must:

- Submit a form attesting to their status as a researcher.
- Agree to keep the dataset private and not publicly share it.
- Use the dataset only for research on evaluation of recommendation systems and similar purposes.
- Refrain from attempting to identify any anonymous participants in the dataset.

Any other uses of the dataset are strictly prohibited.  These
restrictions are in-place to abide by the informed consent that
participants provided for "broad consent for the storage and future
unspecified use of data" as per [TCPS 2 (2022), Chapter 3, Section
E](https://ethics.gc.ca/eng/tcps2-eptc2_2022_chapter3-chapitre3.html#e).
To have the data available without restriction would require blanket
consent, which is not permitted by TCPS 2 (2022).

## **Requesting Access**

To request access to the dataset, please [submit the required form](https://forms.gle/SUTtKLjNyRn2fKYCA)

Once granted access, you will be added as a collaborator with
